Universal Semantic Tagging (UST; Bjerva et al., 2016) aims to provide lightweight unified analysis for all languages at the word level. This moderate-sized corpus provides high-quality manual annotations of UST for  English and Chinese.

The data source consists of 1100  English--Chinese parallel sentences  from  the  Wall  Street Journal (WSJ)  section  of  Penn  TreeBank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) and 1000 sentences from Chinese TreeBank (CTB; Xue et al., 2005). Chinese counterparts of original English sentences in WSJ are literally translated by Englishâ€“Chinese bilinguals.

The first column is tokens; the second one is POS tags automatically predicated by the Stanford CoreNLP tool; the last column is manual annotations of UST, whose observed inter-annotator agreement achieves 92.9% and 91.2% for English and Chinese respectively.

Further details about this corpus can be found in the paper titled *Universal Semantic Tagging for English and Mandarin Chinese*, which is to be published in the proceeding of NAACL 2021. The link of this article will be updated once it is got.
